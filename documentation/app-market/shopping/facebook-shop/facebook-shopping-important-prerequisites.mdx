**Important Prerequisites for Facebook Shopping**

Here are some things to bear in mind when setting up Facebook Shopping on your store. The guidelines are as follows:

1. Setting up your online payment gateway and verifying your website through the Facebook Domain Verification app are mandatory.
2. All your store policies must be added and visible on your website.
3. Your contact information (address, email, and phone number) must be visible on your website.
4. Make sure your product description and short description are comprehensive and up to date.
5. Make sure all the mandatory product fields are filled to ensure seamless feed creation.
6. Use high-quality images for your products.
7. If there are any changes made to the product information (pricing, description, images, etc.), the products in question need to be deleted from your Facebook Shopping feed in aasaan, and a new feed must be created.
