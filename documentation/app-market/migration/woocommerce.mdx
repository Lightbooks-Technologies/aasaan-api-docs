If you have an existing WooCommerce store and you wish to migrate all your data (products, orders, customer info, etc.) to aasaan, you can easily do it with our WooCommerce migration app. Here's how you do it:

*Note: Make sure to install the WooCommerce app from the aasaan app market. Click [here](install-app-link) to learn how to install apps from your app market.*

### Part 1: Getting the WooCommerce Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

**STEP 1:**  
Login to your WordPress account and click on WooCommerce > Settings.

**STEP 2:**  
Click on Advanced.

**STEP 3:**  
Click on Rest API.

**STEP 4:**  
Click on Add Key.

**STEP 5:**  
Enter the description and choose the permission as Read/Write. The user can remain the same. Then click on Generate API Key.

**STEP 6:**  
Copy the consumer key and consumer secret immediately and paste them in a safe place.

*Note: The consumer secret is only displayed once. So take extra care to save it.*

### Part 2: Entering the API keys into aasaan

**STEP 1:**  
Go to your installed WooCommerce app in aasaan. Enter your WooCommerce store URL, consumer key, and consumer secret. Then click on Link.

*Note: When you enter your WooCommerce store URL, make sure to enter "/wp-json" at the end. For example if your URL is example.com, you must enter example.com/wp-json.*

Your API keys are successfully verified.

**STEP 2:**  
Once the API keys are verified, go to your click on WooCommerce once more, and click on Migrate.

A message will appear indicating that the migration process has begun.

You can track the migration status by clicking on the icons shown to track the ongoing and completed migrations.
