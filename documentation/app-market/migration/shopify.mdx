If you wish to bring all your data (products, orders, customer info, etc.) from Shopify to aasaan, you can easily do it with our migration feature. Here's how you do it:

*Note: Make sure to install the Shopify app from the aasaan app market. Click [here](install-app-link) to learn how to install apps from your app market.*

### Part 1: Setting up the Shopify API

**STEP 1:**  
Login to your Shopify admin panel and click on Apps.

**STEP 2:**  
Click on Develop Apps for your store.

**STEP 3:**  
Click on Allow Custom App Development.

**STEP 4:**  
Click on Allow Custom App Development.

*Note: If you have developed apps on Shopify before, you might not have to complete steps 3 and 4.*

**STEP 5:**  
Click on Create an app.

**STEP 6:**  
Enter the app name and click on Create App.

**STEP 7:**  
Click on API Credentials.

**STEP 8:**  
Click on Configure Admin API Scopes.

**STEP 9:**  
Now you have to define the Admin API Access Scopes. Here you get to decide what data you want to migrate from your Shopify store to your aasaan store.

*Note: Make sure you include at least these four access scopes: Inventory, Orders, Products and Customers. These are mandatory.*

**STEP 10:**  
Once you have defined your Access Scopes, click on Save.

**STEP 11:**  
Click on Install App.  
Click on Install.

**STEP 12:**  
Now your app is successfully installed. To migrate your data to aasaan, you need two things:  
- The Admin API Access Token

*Note: Click on Reveal token once to display the token, and then save it in a safe place. This token is only displayed once.*

- The API Key

We need to copy both these codes and paste them into the aasaan app.

### Part 2: Migrating your Data from Shopify to aasaan

**STEP 1:**  
Go to your installed Shopify app in aasaan. Enter the store URL, the API key, and the Admin API Access Token. Then click on Link.

*Note: You need to enter your Shopify domain in the store URL field. It will look like this: example.myshopify.com*

**STEP 2:**  
Once the API keys are verified, go to your click on Shopify once more, and click on Migrate.

A message will appear indicating that the migration status has begun.

You can track the ongoing and completed migrations by clicking on the download and upload buttons respectively.

This is how your migration tracking screen will look.
