Fomo is a simple, automated social proof solution for businesses. With it, you can display live customer interactions on your website to visitors to demonstrate social proof. For example, whenever someone purchases a product of yours, a notification will appear to your website visitors at that moment. This has the effect of signaling that other customers purchase from you.
