  ### Part 1: Setting up your Domain & Sender Authentication

  Domain authentication, crucial for email deliverability and sender reputation, involves configuring DNS entries to authorize SendGrid to send emails on your behalf. Follow the steps in the SendGrid UI under Settings > Sender Authentication to add the provided DNS records to your DNS provider.

To set up domain authentication:

1. In the SendGrid UI, select Settings > Sender Authentication.
2. In the domain authentication section, click Get Started.
3. Next, add in information about your DNS host, and indicate whether you also want to set up link branding. Click Next. For more information about link branding, check out: What is link branding?. Note: We recommend you select Yes to set up link branding.
4. Fill in the domain that you want to send from and add advanced settings as needed. Make sure that you only enter the name of your root domain. Do not include www or http://www in this field. Your domain needs to match the domain of your FROM address on the emails you are sending out. For example, if I am sending an email from example@sendgrid.com, I would set my domain authentication domain to be sendgrid.com. Click Next. For more information about advanced settings, see Advanced settings.
5. Next, you need to add all of the CNAME records on this screen to your DNS host. This process varies depending on your DNS host. For videos on how to add your CNAME to some popular DNS service providers, check out these videos. If you don't have access to modify your company's DNS records, you can also email a request to a co-worker. This email includes a direct link to the CNAME records. This link does expire. The recipient doesn't need login access to your SendGrid account.

  After adding the CNAME records, return to SendGrid to verify the setup. For detailed instructions on verifying a single sender, click [here](verify-sender-link).
