## Google Shopping: Important Prerequisites

**Important Prerequisites for Google Shopping**

Here are some things to bear in mind when setting up Google Shopping on your store. Following these guidelines will maximize your chances of your product listings being approved on Google. Failure to follow the guidelines given can make your Google Merchant Center account liable for suspension.

The guidelines are as follows:

1. Setting up your online payment gateway and verifying your website on Google Search are mandatory.
2. All your store policies must be added and visible on your website.
    1. Make sure that the information you provide in the shipping policy and returns and refunds policy on your website matches the information provided in the "Shipping and Returns" section in your Google Merchant Center account.
    2. If you have set a minimum checkout amount on your store, make sure to add the same in the Advanced Settings of the "Shipping" section in your Google Merchant Center account.
3. Make sure your product description and short description are comprehensive and up to date.
4. Use high-quality images for your products.
5. Make sure all the mandatory product fields are filled to ensure seamless feed creation.
6. Make sure your store has all your contact details, and those details are matching the information provided in your Merchant Center account.
7. If possible, add a GTIN for your products. Click [here](#) to know more about the GTIN.
8. Once you create your product feed on Google Shopping, it usually expires after 30 days. Don't forget to recreate your product feeds every 30 days.
9. If there are any changes made to the product information or shipping and returns policies on the website, those have to be updated in the Google Merchant Center account as well. For any updates in product information (pricing, description, images, etc.), the products in question need to be deleted from the Merchant Center account, and a new feed must be created from the Google Shopping app in aasaan.

Here is a spreadsheet with the checklist of items to bear in mind when setting up your Merchant Center account and integrating it into your store. Completing the action items listed in the spreadsheet will maximize the chances of your account and products being approved on Google Merchant Center.
