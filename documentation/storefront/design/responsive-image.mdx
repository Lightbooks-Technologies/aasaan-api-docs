In the aasaan app, you can resize your images, set the number of products in each row, and even set your standard aspect ratio for product images. Here's how you do it:

**STEP 1:**
Log in to your aasaan desktop admin panel and click on Website Settings.

**STEP 2:**
Click on the settings icon.

**STEP 3:**
Click on Responsive Image.

**STEP 4:**
To make your images responsive (resizing them to the appropriate ratios), enable the corresponding toggles for product, category, and widget images.

**STEP 5:**
Then if you wish to display your images in the size you prefer: small, medium, or large, you can enable the respective toggle. This also affects the number of product images you see in each row. Here we're choosing the Medium setting, which leads to there being three products in each row.
A preview is visible on the right hand side.

**STEP 6:**
Finally, you can choose the standard aspect ratio you wish to follow for your product images: square, portrait, or landscape. In this case, we will set the standard aspect ratio as square.

You have successfully configured the responsive image settings on your website.
