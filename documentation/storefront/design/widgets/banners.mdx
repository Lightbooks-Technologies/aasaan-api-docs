We have a wide range of banners you can use to customize your website homepage. They are as follows:
- Basic Banner
- Single column Banner
- Two-column banner
- Three column banner with slider (with the slider being either on the right or the left)

Since the process of creating these different kinds of banners is similar, we will just be discussing the process of creating the two column banner.
