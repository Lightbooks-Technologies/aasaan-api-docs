## Design your website homepage
aasaan offers a comprehensive website builder that allows you to create a unique and professional storefront without writing a single line of code. You can add blocks such as banners, deals, categories and new arrivals, improve your navigation experience with a mega menu, and customize the overall styling of your homepage with our theme settings. 


## Pre-builts

Aasaan offers two comprehensive libraries full of prebuilt designs: Widgets and Templates.

### Widgets

A Section in Aasaan is a prebuilt part of a page. This could be a Hero section highlighting a specific product or collection, or a Feature section showcasing the unique selling points (USPs) of your brand or products.

#### Building a Page with Widgets

1. In the Builder, open the Pages tab and click + next to Pages.
2. Select "Empty" to start building a page from scratch.
3. Open the Insert tab and ensure the selector at the top is set to Section.
4. Find the Widgets you want and drag them onto your page.
5. Customize the Widgets:
    - Style them as needed.
    - Change their Text and Images.
    - Link them to your Shopify products/collections as eCommerce elements.

### Templates

A Template in Aasaan is an entire prebuilt website. Starting with a Template means you begin with a page that has already been designed, requiring only customization to align with your brand.
