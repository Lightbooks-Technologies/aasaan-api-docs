## Publishing Your Aasaan Website

Publishing your Aasaan website is an essential step to make your application and its pages accessible to your audience.

### Initial Publication

- **Staging Environment**: Initially, your Aasaan website is assigned a random subdomain (e.g., `https://<randomname>.aasaan.io`) and published to the Staging environment. This stage is private and only visible to you.
- **Domain and Publication Status**: You can view your domain information and publication status by clicking the 'Publish' button in the top navigation bar of the Aasaan platform.

### Going Live

- **Publishing to Live Environment**: When you're ready to make your website visible to the public, publish your changes to the Live environment by clicking the 'Publish' button in the pop-up.
- **Sharing Your Website**: After publishing, share the public subdomain link (e.g., "https://example.aasaan.io").

### Previewing Your Aasaan Website

- **Preview Option**: Aasaan provides an option to preview your website before publishing. This allows you to see how it works and appears.
- **Preview as Specific Users**: You can preview the website as specific users to understand their experience. To do this, click on the Play icon in the upper right of Aasaan Studio.
- **Shareable Preview Link**: Generate a shareable preview link for others to view your website in its pre-published state.
- **Device Screen Size Preview**: Use the device selector to see how your website appears on different devices.
