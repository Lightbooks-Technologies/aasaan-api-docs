### Mobile App Availability

The mobile app (PWA) feature is available for users on the Business plan and above.

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that deliver an experience akin to native desktop and mobile apps. With PWAs, your Aasaan app users can install it on their device and access it via an icon on their home screen or elsewhere. Let's explore how you can enable and configure PWA on your Aasaan app.

### Configuring PWA in Aasaan
To set up PWA, navigate to the Mobile App settings within your Aasaan app's Application Settings. Here, you will find options to activate a PWA for your Aasaan app and tailor its appearance.
