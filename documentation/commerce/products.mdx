Creating products is the first step to setting up a complete online store. You can easily add products to your store by adding the product details and uploading images. Furthermore, if your product has options such as size, color, weight, or volume, you can also create variants based on these options.

What's more, you can upload and/or update thousands of products in minutes with our bulk upload and bulk update features. Finally, when customers leave reviews on your products, you can either approve or reject them.

        </Note>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Brands">
        **Brands**: If you sell shoes, you might have different brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma. Each brand has its own unique style and target audience.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Tags">
        **Tags**: Let‚Äôs say you sell clothing. You can use tags to group your products by color, size, or material. For example, you can tag a red shirt as ‚Äúred,‚Äù ‚Äúshirt,‚Äù and ‚Äúcotton.‚Äù
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="SKU">
        **SKU**: If you sell electronics, each product will have a unique SKU. For example, a laptop might have the SKU ‚ÄúLPTP-001.‚Äù
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="GTIN">
        **GTIN**: If you sell products on a global scale, you might need to use GTINs to identify your products. For example, a book might have an ISBN code.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Custom Fields">

Each variant of a product has its own unique identifier, such as a SKU or GTIN, so it can be tracked separately from other variants.

Each variant would have its own unique identifier, such as a SKU or GTIN, so you can track inventory levels and sales for each size separately.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Recommended Products">
        **Recommended Products**: Let‚Äôs say a customer is browsing your website and is interested in a particular product.

            - tab for you to add your variants.

            - and tab for you to add your brands.
        <Note> Note: The options tab will only show color and size variants by default. If you want to add additional options and variants(like weight, volume, or additional colors and sizes) to be displayed in the bulk upload sheet, create a product manually with the extra options/variants you wish to add, and then download the bulk upload sheet. </Note>
        - Add your category details like name and description.
        - Add your product name, description, and short description.
        - Add the image URLs, pricing, and inventory information(quantity and SKU).

        - Enter further product details like weight, dimensions, category name, and brand name.
        - If your products have variants, then you can add their details in the variants tab.
        - To add variants to your products, first add your variants in the options columns such as "Color(options)" and "Size(options)". Then add the product name in column M for each row in which the variant is present. For example, in this case, we are creating the following size variants:
            - small
            - medium
            - large
        - We will add these variants in the column "Size(options)" and assign the product name to each size variant as shown.
        - Finally, add the brand details in the Brands tab.
        - After adding the product details in the import spreadsheet, go back to the aasaan admin panel and select the channel you wish to import your products in, as shown.
        <Note> Note: The feature of choosing a channel to import your products into is only available on the business plan.</Note>
