## Products

Creating products is the first step to setting up a complete online store. You can easily add products to your store by adding the product details and uploading images. Furthermore, if your product has options such as size, color, weight, or volume, you can also create variants based on these options.

What's more, you can upload and/or update thousands of products in minutes with our bulk upload and bulk update features.

Finally, when customers leave reviews on your products, you can either approve or reject them.

In this section, you will learn how to manage your products, upload them in bulk, and manage your reviews.
