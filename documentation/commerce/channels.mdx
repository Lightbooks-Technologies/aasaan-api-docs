### Add channels to your store

**How to Add Channels to Your Store**

You can use aasaan to sell your products on different online sales channels. Sales channels represent the different geographical regions where you sell your products. You can customize your product pricing, currency, taxes, warehouses, and shipping methods for each channel in your store. This feature is especially useful if you wish to launch your brand globally. For example, if you wish to sell in India and the United States, you can create the respective channels for both countries in your store, and customize the currency, tax rates, and other details for each channel.

*Note: The channels feature is only offered on the business plan.*

**STEP 1:**

Login to your aasaan desktop admin panel and click on Manage.
