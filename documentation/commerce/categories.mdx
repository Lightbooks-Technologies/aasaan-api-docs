Before you add your first product to your store, you must add a category.

Here's how you add categories to your store:

**STEP 1:**
Log in to your aasaan desktop admin panel and click on Categories.

**STEP 2:**
Click on +New.

**STEP 3:**
Upload the category image, and then enter the category name and description.

**STEP 6:**
If you wish to list your products on Google Merchant Center, click on the toggle to enable Google Shopping.

**STEP 7:**
Enter the Google Shopping Category that most closely matches your category.

*Note: Google has its own list of categories for ecommerce businesses. This step is important if you want to list your products on Google Merchant Center. [Click here](google-category-link) to view Google's full list of categories.*

**STEP 7:**
Click on Save. You have successfully saved your category.

**STEP 8:**
Now, if you want to add a subcategory within this category, it is just like creating a regular category, but with one small addition which we will cover.

Click on +New.

**STEP 9:**
Add the category image, name and description as shown in steps 4 and 5. Now to mark this as a subcategory, you need to declare its parent category.

For example, Men's Jacket is a parent category of Men's Denim Jackets. So Men's Denim Jackets is a subcategory.

**STEP 10:**
Add the Google shopping category as shown in step 6 and click on Save.

**STEP 11:**
You have saved your subcategory. Note that parent categories have the tag "Parent" attached to them.
