## Order Status

First let's take a look at the various statuses of an order.

| Order Status   | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| New Order      | A new order recieved by the store                    |
| Approved       | The order has been accepted by the store             |
| Shipped        | The order has been shipped by the store              |
| Cancelled      | The order has been cancelled by the store            |
| Completed      | The order has been fulfilled means delivered         |

<Note>Order status 'New Order' and 'Pending' are one and the same. It means that the store received a new order and an action is pending from the store.</Note>

        - Log in to your aasaan desktop admin panel and click on **Orders**.
        - Orders are made available in multiple tabs based on various order status like:
            - New Order
            - Approved
            - Shipped
            - Cancelled
            - Completed
        - There is an **ALL** tab which lists all the orders irrespective of the status.
        <Tip>
        Click on the order to view further order details. You can see order information like the shipping address, contact details, and the items ordered.
        </Tip>
        - When you get an order, the order status is set to **New Order**.
        - Click on New Order.  Here you can set the status of the order. You can click on the respective option to change the order status to Accepted, Shipped, Cancelled or Complete.  
        - If you change the status to accepted, your customer will get an notification saying their order has been accepted.
        <Note>

            2. Once you change the order status to accepted, the order automatically goes to your integrated shipping partner account. For example, if you have integrated Pickrr to your website, the order goes to your Pickrr dashboard.
            3. If you have integrated a shipping partner, a print button will appear so that you can print the shipping label within your aasaan admin panel itself.
            4. You can also download the order receipt by clicking the receipt icon.
