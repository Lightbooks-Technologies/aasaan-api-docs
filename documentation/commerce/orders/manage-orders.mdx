You can watch the video version of this article [here](#).

Here's how to manage orders that customers have placed on your Aasaan store.

**STEP 1:**
Log in to your Aasaan desktop admin panel click on Orders.

**STEP 2:**
If a customer abandoned your cart, or a payment failed, you can see them by clicking on Abandoned Cart and Failed Payments respectively.

**STEP 3:**
When you get a new order, click on the button on the right shown to view order details and download the order receipt.  
Click on Download Invoice to download the order receipt.  
Your receipt will look like this.

**STEP 5:**
Click on View Order to view further order details.  
You can see further order information like the customer's complete address, contact details, and the items ordered.

**STEP 6:**
Click on New Order.  
Here you can set the status of the order. You can click on the respective option to change the order status to Accepted, Shipped, Cancelled or Complete.  
You can also change the order status on the main orders screen by clicking on New Order.  
If you change the status to accepted, your order will look like this. Your customer will get an SMS notification saying their order has been accepted.

**Points to note:**
1. If the customer enters an email address in their profile or during their checkout, then they will get an email notification when their order status has been changed.
2. Once you change the order status to accepted, the order automatically goes to your integrated shipping partner account. For example, if you have integrated Pickrr to your website, the order goes to your Pickrr dashboard.
3. If you have integrated a shipping partner, a print button will appear so that you can print the shipping label within your aasaan admin panel itself.

If you change the status to shipped(dispatched for delivery), your order will look like this. Your customer will get an SMS/email notification saying their order has been shipped.  
If you change the status to completed(delivered), your order will look like this. Your customer will get an SMS/email notification saying their order has been completed.
