                For a particular feature, you can set the permission as "View Access" or "Manage Access".
                "View Access" means that the staff member assigned to this role can only view that particular feature.
                "Manage Access" means that the staff member assigned to this role can manage or make changes in that particular feature.
                If you wish, you can configure features as "No Access" which will prevent them from accessing that feature altogether.

                **STEP 7:**
                When you are done configuring the permissions for the role, click on Save.
