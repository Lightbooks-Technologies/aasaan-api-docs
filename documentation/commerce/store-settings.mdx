                **STEP 3:**
                You are taken to the staff page. Here you can see that you are the owner of this store. This means that you have access to every single feature of running the store. To add a staff member, click on the button **+ Invite Others**.

                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-03.png" />

                **STEP 6:**
                Now the staff member needs to accept the invitation.
                So they need to open the invite email, and click on Create Staff Account.

                </Frame>

                In your admin panel, the status of your staff member will change to "Accepted".
                You have successfully added a staff member to your store.

                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-10.png" />
                </Frame>
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Staff Roles">
                When you are adding your staff members to your aasaan store, you get a set of predefined roles to choose from. But you can also create your own custom roles. Here's how you do it:

                **STEP 1:**
                Login to your aasaan desktop admin panel and click on Manage.
                <Frame>
                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-11.png" />
                </Frame>

                **STEP 2:**
                Click on Manage Staff.

                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-12.png" />
                </Frame>

                **STEP 3:**
                You are taken to the staff page. Click on Manage Roles.
                <Frame>
                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-13.png" />
                </Frame>

                **STEP 4:**
                Click on Add Role.
                <Frame>
                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-14.png" />

                </Frame>

                **STEP 6:**
                Now we have to set the appropriate permissions. When it comes to permissions, the default setting for each part of the app is "No access". This means the staff member cannot view or edit that particular part of the app.
                For a particular feature, you can set the permission as "View Access" or "Manage Access".
                "View Access" means that the staff member assigned to this role can only view that particular feature.
                "Manage Access" means that the staff member assigned to this role can manage or make changes in that particular feature.
                If you wish, you can configure features as "No Access" which will prevent them from accessing that feature altogether.

                **STEP 7:**
                When you are done configuring the permissions for the role, click on Save.

## Channel Settings
In this section, you will learn how to manage channels.

### Channels
    <Accordion title="Manage Channels">
        You can use aasaan to sell your products on different online sales channels. Sales channels represent the different geographical regions where you sell your products. You can customize your product pricing, currency, taxes, warehouses, and shipping methods for each channel in your store. This feature is especially useful if you wish to launch your brand globally. For example, if you wish to sell in India and the United States, you can create the respective channels for both countries in your store, and customize the currency, tax rates, and other details for each channel.

        <Note>The channels feature is only offered on the business plan.</Note>

        The steps for creating channels in your store are as follows:

        **STEP 1:**
