            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Staff Roles">
                When you are adding your staff members to your aasaan store, you get a set of predefined roles to choose from. But you can also create your own custom roles. Here's how you do it:

                **STEP 1:**
                Login to your aasaan desktop admin panel and click on Manage.
                <Frame>
                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-11.png" />
                </Frame>

                **STEP 2:**
                Click on Manage Staff.
                <Frame>
                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-12.png" />
                </Frame>

                **STEP 3:**
                You are taken to the staff page. Click on Manage Roles.
                <Frame>
                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-13.png" />

                **STEP 4:**
                Click on Add Role.
                <Frame>
                <img src="https://cdn.lightbooks-dev.io/docs/manage/staff/staff-14.png" />

                </Frame>

                **STEP 6:**
                Now we have to set the appropriate permissions. When it comes to permissions, the default setting for each part of the app is "No access". This means the staff member cannot view or edit that particular part of the app.
                For a particular feature, you can set the permission as "View Access" or "Manage Access".
                "View Access" means that the staff member assigned to this role can only view that particular feature.
                "Manage Access" means that the staff member assigned to this role can manage or make changes in that particular feature.
                If you wish, you can configure features as "No Access" which will prevent them from accessing that feature altogether.
