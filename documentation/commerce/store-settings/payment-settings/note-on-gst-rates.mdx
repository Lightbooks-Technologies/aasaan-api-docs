## Note on GST Rates

**Important note on GST Rates**

*aasaan offers the option to set your overall GST rate in payment settings, and your CGST and SGST rates in your product page. This may lead to confusion about which rates will apply.*

These three points will make things clear:

1. If product-level GST(CGST & SGST) is left blank and you have set your overall GST rate in payment settings, then the overall rate will apply.
2. If you have set both the product-level and overall GST rates, then the product-level GST rates will apply.
3. If you are buying multiple products - some of which have the product-level rates and others have the overall GST rate - the tax calculation is done individually for each product during checkout.
