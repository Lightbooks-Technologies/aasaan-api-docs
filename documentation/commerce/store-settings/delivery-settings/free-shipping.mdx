If you want your shipping rates to be free, here is how you do it with our advanced shipping methods.

**STEP 1:**

Create a new shipping method. You can learn how to do so in the parent article of this section: [How to create a shipping method](#).

**STEP 2:**

Enter the shipping method details (name and warehouse). Then specify the delivery zone. Since we are applying this shipping method worldwide, we will select No Limitation. Finally, we will select the delivery type. Here we will select Local. You can choose a shipping integration like Shiprocket if you prefer.

**STEP 3:**

Since the Free Delivery toggle is enabled by default, click on Save.
Your shipping method has been saved.
