In aasaan, you can add your employees and assign them specific roles for managing your store. Here's how you do it:

**STEP 1:**
Login to your aasaan app and click on Manage.

**STEP 2:**
Click on Manage Staff.

**STEP 3:**
You are taken to the staff page. Here you can see that you are the owner of this store. This means that you have access to every single feature of running the store. To add a staff member, click on Invite Others.

**STEP 4:**
Enter the staff member's email address.

**STEP 5:**
Assign a particular role to the staff member. Each role has specified permissions; they are allowed to manage/view only certain features. You can either use the pre-existing roles or create new roles of your own based on your needs.
Here we will choose the role "MyRole". Check that box and click on Save.
The staff member should be visible and their status should be "Invited".

**STEP 6:**
Now the staff member needs to accept the invitation.
So they need to open the invite email, and click on Create Staff Account.

**STEP 7:**
They will be prompted to signup to aasaan.
They need to enter the authentication code sent to their email address, their personal information, and click on Submit.

**STEP 8:**
Once they enter their details, they will be prompted to click on Accept Invite.
Upon accepting the invitation, they will be able to see the admin panel.
In your admin panel, the status of your staff member will change to "Accepted".
You have successfully added a staff member to your store.
