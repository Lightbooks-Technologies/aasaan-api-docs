Use webhooks to get notified about events related to the Aasaan such as orders, inventory, products and customers.

Webhooks (Web Callback, HTTP Push API or Reverse API) are one way that a web application can send information to another application in real-time when a specific event happens.

### Webhook Vs API

APIs send you the data when you request it. For Webhooks, you do not need to make a request. You receive the data when it is available.

### Example

If you need to know whether an Order has been placed or not, using APIs, you need to keep polling every few seconds until the api returns data containing a new order. However, if you are using Webhooks, you can configure a webhook event `Order Created` to receive notifications when a new order has been placed.
